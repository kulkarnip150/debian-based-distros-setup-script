## Created small shell script to adjust power setting in pop-os according to battery status and capacity.
```to run a shell script at startup add crontab entry by following command```
```deff
crontab -e
@reboot sh /<path to file>/switch_power_profile.sh
```
```diff

! this script will access 2 files every 60 seconds

```
